My Customer Journey project is a challenging opportunity to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, model design, data quality assurance, insight generation to support decision-making, and predictive modeling. Through this project, I aim to showcase my capabilities and gain valuable experience in addressing common business challenges within the banking industry.

My project focuses on the topic of Customer Onboarding Journey – the process of welcoming new customers. In this project, I build a model simulating a real-life scenario at a bank that applies a digital process for customers by using eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) technology.

This process includes the stages from introducing services to customers, creating a digital account, and performing transactions, to post-onboarding monitoring in order to track customers’ transaction behaviors. The aim is to assess the potential fraud risk of customers, thereby improving the fraud prediction model and helping the business operate more effectively.

To achieve this, I set out the following objectives:

## [CASE 1 - DATA MODEL DESIGN](https://github.com/quachquoccuong2904/Customer-Journey/tree/main/CASE%201%20-%20DATA%20MODEL%20DESIGN)

In this first part, I begin by identifying the core concept and the onboarding process itself. I then define the key attributes and the relationships between them, while also establishing rules and standards for data collection and storage. The main focus of this phase is to design a suitable data model that ensures clarity, consistency, and scalability.

## [CASE 2 - METADATA MANAGEMENT AND DATA QUALITY](https://github.com/quachquoccuong2904/Customer-Journey/tree/main/CASE%202%20-%20METADATA%20MANAGEMENT%20AND%20DATA%20QUALITY)

In the second part, I explore metadata management to ensure data quality, by providing a clear understanding of how to identify critical data attributes, validate integrity, and ensure consistency in data.

## [CASE 3 - REPORTING AND ANALYTICS](https://github.com/quachquoccuong2904/Customer-Journey/tree/main/CASE%203%20-%20REPORTING%20AND%20ANALYTICS)

In the third part, I conduct analyses and reporting based on the onboarding process. I aim to identify key metrics that determine the success of a campaign, and then use analytical and visualization tools to uncover valuable insights. These insights help the business better understand its customers and improve the overall onboarding process.

## [CASE 4 - FRAUD PREDICTION](https://github.com/quachquoccuong2904/Customer-Journey/tree/main/CASE%204%20-%20FRAUD%20PREDICTION)

In the final part, I evaluate the performance of the verification process, starting from the stage where the customer opens an account and performs their first transaction, up until the system identifies the customer's Fraud Type based on the provided information and their post-eKYC behavior. Finally, I develop a fraud prediction model to detect potential high-risk cases early, enabling the operations team to proactively prevent fraud and enhance the overall security of the onboarding process.
